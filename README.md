# SportsStore Overview

I decided it was a good time to learn a new language,framework, etc, and the best way for me to learn is by example.
So I got the book, "Pro ASP.NET MVC 5" by Adam Freeman and started reading. 
Chapters 7-12 put everything that was previously taught together by creating a basic eCommerce application.

## Major Concepts learned:


* I have learned about MVC in the past from a class and even used the deasign for a class project.
This tutorial taught me what a clean project looks like. Everything was organized. The code was so clean, there was really no need to comment because you can read the code like a manual/book. Now I truley understand the meaning of "clean simple code."

* I also leaned how Object Oriented Design applies in the real world. I school, we are taught about the OO principles and a bit about design, but not enough to comprehend the importance of it. When you google OOP, you are always given definitions and a simple example anout shapes/people/animals. But seeing it work in a way a software engineer would use it in industry was a real eye opener.

## Chapter 7: build core infrastructure

* Setting up the applications by downloading packages, adding references.
* Creating product repository and setting up database.
* Listing 'n' products per page.
* clean up the page by adding partial view and css

## Chapter 8: navigation menu

* created nav menu and add routing to filter by category
* began building shopping cart that uses the users session to keep the cart.
* add to cart button

## Chapter 9: Completing the cart

## Chapter 10: Mobile  - skipped because I wanted to learn the fundementals.

## Chapter 11: Administration

## Chapter 12: Security and Finishing touches
