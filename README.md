# Overview

I decided it was a good time to learn a new language,framework, etc, and the best way for me to learn is by example.
So I got the book, "Pro ASP.NET MVC 5" by Adam Freeman and started reading. 
Chapters 7-12 put everything that was previously taught together by creating a basic eCommerce application.
